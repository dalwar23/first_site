    1. Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
    I warmly welcome you to pursuit of happyness. This is the best moment to tell you all that this is a strictly personal website.This website has a very long history to come up with. From the very begaining I always tried to make something reasonablly preferable to all of you to tell you the truth. From the very first day i got into these much complexity of this world i tried more and more to tell everyone the real truth. I was not stupid and i am not now. Telling the truth is sometimes too much hard to do. From the day i tried to tell thetruth i encountered so many problems that my truths got crushed under them. From time to time i tried to write diaries and blogs but most of them are now not avileable. Somehow my written papers are destroyed or being destroyed. About those blogs i have ever blogged, it was my misfortune that most of them were outdated and being deleted. But luckyly one of them survied to tell you the truth and i recently stated a new BLOG to keep you up to date with the life style i am leading. But i am sorry that they are only visible for the invited members for a certain period of time. My website and blogs will be open to all after somedays. So, to get started these are all you need to know. Thank you!

    2. For whom this site is ?
    </h3>
    <p>
		About this site, this is the most complex question up to now for me. This site is dedicated to ONE single person and can be viewable to 3/4 invited persons only for a certain period of time. Aafter that this site is for everyone who has ever come to face to face contact with me. At first when i thought to do something like this i wanted to make things straight for every one but now my situations a much more complex then ever so i dicided to make it a personal wesite to make sure that the right pice of information goes to right people and they don't mess up like me So i recomand you to understand the need of this site and respect and believe the things you see here. Thank you!

    3. Encyption key page or (Index page)
    </h3>
    <p>
    	This page is the first page of the website. This page comes up with a level shouting for the encryption keys. These encryption keys are like passwords. You may have seen that most of the wesite uses USERNAME and PASSWORD combination to login to their website but here you see only encryption keys a.k.a password. So you can ask why? This a security process i want implimnet here that's all.what are the benefits? The only one benefit is that only those can enter the site who were given an encryption key combination prior to the building of this site. This thing has been done to restrict visit to the site. Actually to tell you the truth this page is the door to the main site and and has a lock of 16 bit long encryption combination and only one person have this keys.So i call it master encryption keys. If you are reading this so you must know who have this encryption keys. thank you!

    4. What are Encryption keys ?
    </h3>
    <p> 
    	The encryption keys are like passwords and can be written down as a string. I suppose you have used passwords before in many websites.But why i call this as Encryption keys? Because they are a little more then passwords. As an example the Master encryption key is the combination of 32 bits of data in a right pattern. Something like puzzle inside the puzzle. If u can manage to get the 32 bits long data that will not help you to open the site. You must also know the patterns to put them togather. This is how the encryption is made for better security of the site. Thank you!

    5. Home Page
    </h3>
    <p> 
    	Now once you have managed to get the perfect combination of the encryption keys then you will be logged in to the home page. This is the main page of the site. Thsi page contains a few links to the other pages e.g Mohona , Dr.Anwar , Blog etc. This links are offered as a menu item and you can move through the pages by clicking them. There is a link called logout at right side of the menu bar that will take out of the site.If you want to get out of the site then it's highly recomanded that you must logout from the site to prevent security threat. This page also contains a few paragraphs that explains many things to the logged in user or users. Thank You!

    6. About the tabed links
    </h3>
    <p>   
    	This part of the User Manual deals with the links that you will face at Home page. This links works as a simple link as it was supposed to but when you will click to those links most of them or 2/3 links will present you with 4 white boxes and a button. Just to tell you that these are also encrypted locks but personal and more secure then before. I will not talk much about them but tell you one thing that with all other requirements, these will need a sharp memory to unlock. Now comes the Blog tab. This tab is linked directly to blog own and modified by the Admistrator designed by wordpress.You can register for the blog any time and post your thoughts. It's always open for everyone. You can register any time you like. But remember one thing that this is just a link to the blog. This website and the Blog stand apart from eachother. Thank You!

    7. To whom it may concern
    </h3>
    <p>   
    	This part of the user manual deals with one last tabed link in the home page. This is the tab named More links. This page contains links to different sites. These links are and will be important for whoever want to know the truth. You may think that a song lyric , a vedio link , a download link ? How can it express the truth ? To whom i am writing this may mean something. So i do recomend that please check out all the links very very care fully. All the things you see and hear and get in this website is an expression of my mind and thoughts. Thank You!

    8. Inspiration and Dedication
    </h3>
    <p>
    	This part is easy to tell you about. I worked hard to build this website for a long time cause i had to study a lot to build this from the scratch. I read and built but believe me or not, more the 100 times i changed my mind about the design and the other things after all these days i finally got one perfact design and got settled with that. This is a small website can be built in 3/4 days but it took me 3/4 months because i was confused about the design and the other things i implimented and on the other side i had to study and do my social duties to my family aand etc. The real inspiration behind this work was, is and will be my better half, my Angel ,love of my life and my soulmate, my wife MOHONA.<br />
        Mohona , as you know from the name of the website that it's for you but i have to say it aloud so that each and everyone can hear it. This website is dedicated to most wonderful, smart and most amzing wife in this world who will be the most amazing mother in future. My dear MOHONA it's for you.
